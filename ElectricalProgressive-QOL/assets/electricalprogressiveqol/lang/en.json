The effects of heaters can be cumulative: you can view the total bonus on any of them. Bonus information is updated as soon as one of the plants recalculates. <br>Growing fruit trees won't become easier: you'll still have to follow all their growth cycles, so you'll need to use heaters to regulate the resulting temperature according to the tree's current stage. Cuttings must overwinter for several days at low temperatures, and then by gradually increasing the temperature, wait for them to take root (or not). After that, you can further increase the internal temperature to comfortable values for that particular tree, and it will begin to flower, bear fruit, etc. Each tree has its own temperature ranges, so be careful not to harm it. Once it has finished bearing fruit, you can forcibly put the tree back into dormancy. The cycle then repeats as many times as needed.",
