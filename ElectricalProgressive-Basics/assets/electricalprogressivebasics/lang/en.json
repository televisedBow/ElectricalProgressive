  "game:gamemechanicinfo-electricalprogressive-text": "<strong>Electricity: ElectricalProgressive Mod</strong><br>The mod adds electrical energy, electrical appliances, devices, weapons, and armor to the game. All of this helps to ease (or not) survival in the game world, reduce routine tasks, and diversify the gameplay.<br><br><strong>Basics</strong><br>The law of conservation of energy states that energy does not appear from nowhere and does not disappear. Energy only transforms from one form to another or transfers from one body to another. The same applies in the game.<br><br>The main source of mechanical energy is windmills. Generators can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. To do this, use a shaft and/or gear to transmit torque from the windmill to the generator shaft. Electricity generation will then begin.<br><br>Electrical energy can be transmitted via cables to consumers. Simply place cables block by block in the desired direction. Up to 4 cables can be placed on each block face, pointing in different directions. This allows routing cables in any direction and branching the electrical circuit. The cable must be connected to the iron plate of an electrical device for it to start working. Electrical devices, metal blocks, and pass-through connectors can also conduct current.<br><br>Since the wind doesn't always blow at full strength, generator output may be insufficient to power all electrical devices. To avoid this, connect your electrical circuit to an accumulator (or several). They will continuously store electrical energy and supply it to the circuit to power devices at any time, even when there is no wind.<br><br>To save energy, some devices need to be disconnected from the circuit when not in use. For this, a manual switch is used. Install it on a section of the circuit where you need to quickly toggle power.<br><br>For some devices that still require mechanical energy to operate, a motor is needed. It converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Connect it to the device via a shaft. When turned on, the motor will strive to deliver maximum power to the shaft, so ensure the circuit has sufficient energy.",

To do this, cables must be connected to them, and they must be coupled via a shaft.<br><br><strong>Game Mechanics Specifics</strong><br>Motors and generators closely model the behavior of real-life devices. As an example, DC machines were taken. Therefore, to better understand how to use them and in what situations, one needs to understand the laws they operate by.<br>All rotating mechanisms in the game, including shafts and gears, have two basic parameters: torque and resistance. Torque characterizes the force with which a mechanism rotates a shaft, while resistance represents friction forces and losses that may occur during operation. The torque of shafts and gears is zero. The game engine sums all torques and calculates the shaft speed and its acceleration/deceleration. If torque is greater than resistance, the shaft speed increases. If the opposite is true, it decreases. Both parameters change according to specific laws. Usually, resistance increases with speed.<br><br><strong>Generators</strong><br>In the mod, generators have the following additional parameters:<br><i>I_max</i> – maximum energy output;<br><i>speed_max</i> – maximum rated rotation speed;<br><i>resistance_factor</i> – multiplier for resistance torque;<br><i>resistance_load</i> – constant component of resistance torque (achieved at I_max).<br><br>Generator energy output depends only on shaft speed and is calculated proportionally to shaft speed. When exceeding <i>speed_max</i>, output equals <i>power = I_max</i>.<br>Resistance torque first increases linearly, and after exceeding <i>speed_max</i>, it increases quadratically. Resistance torque is also directly proportional to the electrical load on this generator. Therefore, with no consumption, the generator will create minimal resistance torque.<br><br><strong>Motors</strong><br>In the mod, motors have the following additional parameters:<br><i>I_min</i> – minimum energy required for the motor to start working;<br><i>I_max</i> – maximum energy consumption;<br><i>torque_max</i> – maximum torque;<br><i>kpd_max</i> – Efficiency;<br><i>speed_max</i> – maximum rated rotation speed;<br><i>resistance_factor</i> – multiplier for resistance torque.<br><br>A motor delivers torque directly proportional to the energy available to it. The motor also accounts for its own efficiency.<br><br>Motor resistance torque is calculated similarly to a generator, only <i>resistance_load</i> is zero.",

  "game:gamemechanicinfo-electricalprogressive-princip-title": "Electricity: Current Behavior, Voltage",
  "game:gamemechanicinfo-electricalprogressive-princip-text": "<strong>Electricity: Current Behavior, Voltage</strong><br>Electric current now flows through conductors obeying the laws of physics. Some may need to reopen their physics textbooks!<br><br><strong>New Behavior Specifics</strong><br>Electric current moves in conductors as energy packets, except in instant mode. Energy packets move along the shortest path from power sources to consumers. Also, cables and devices now have their own electrical conductor parameters: resistivity (depends on material), cross-sectional area, maximum current (exceeding risks burning), maximum voltage. Current value is calculated using Ohm's law for a circuit segment, for all energy packets passing through that face/block at the moment. The direction of energy movement is also considered: if energy moves in opposite directions, their corresponding currents are algebraically subtracted (a consequence of Kirchhoff's first law). To prevent cables from burning out, they can be thickened. To do this, hold a cable of the same type as the one already placed and click on it while holding the Shift key. This increases the current capacity of the circuit. But note, conductor loss is calculated using Joule-Lenz law. Increasing the passing current significantly increases energy loss. For long-distance energy transmission, voltage can be increased, or accumulators can be used as buffer storage.<br><br><strong>Voltages</strong><br>Now different devices require not only different amounts of energy but also different voltages. Exceeding voltage for a device/cable risks burning it. Voltage can be stepped up or down using a transformer - it works both ways. Therefore, be careful when connecting wires of different voltages! Higher voltage allows pumping more energy through wires.<br><br><strong>Interaction with the Environment</strong><br>Now uninsulated cables and metal blocks will damage all entities upon contact. The higher the voltage in the circuit, the more damage they will receive. Burned appliances and cables will also cause damage. Insulated cables and all working appliances are safe to touch.<br>All cables and devices have a moisture resistance parameter. If there is no moisture resistance, your device/cable risks burning when in contact with rain, snow, hail, or spilled water nearby! Contact with lava will cause them to burn, break, and most likely be destroyed. Be careful.",
